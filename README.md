In this assignment, we will create a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted by using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. The contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

In this application, we will perform the following tasks:

1. Create the KaseiCoin token contract and compile it.

2. Create the KaseiCoin crowdsale contract and compile it.

3. Create the KaseiCoin deployer contract and compile it.

4. Perform a real-world, pre-production test of your crowdsale. In order to do so, you will deploy the crowdsale to a local blockchain by using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache.

5. Use OpenZeppelin to extend the functionality of the crowdsale contract by adding time restrictions, refund capabilities, and a cap for the number of tokens that may be created.

6. Record a short video or take several screenshots that show the deployed contract in action.
